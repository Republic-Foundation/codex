# Ranks & Line of Commands

The ranks of The Foundation are arranged by **Levels** and **Roles**. Levels are universal and apply to everything within the Foundation. The levels are:

### Level 0 [Declassified]
Level 0 is given to individuals who do not need access to any essential information to carry out their duties. Level 0 clearance is generally held by people such as catering staff, temporal janitorial staff, and technical support. Anyone authorized with Level 0 may not access the Foundation database under any circumstance.

### Level 1 [Confidential]

Level 1 clearance is given to individuals such as the ones listed in **Level 0.** The difference between the clearances is that this clearance is given to support staff who have experienced, or will experience in the near future, an encounter with a SCP.

### Level 2 [Restricted]

Level 2 Clearance is given to the majority of the members of the Foundation. It grants a person access to individual classifications on an SCP. Most research staff, field agents, and general personnel hold a Level 2 clearance.  

### Level 3 [Secret]


Level 3 security clearances are given to senior security and research personnel that require in-depth data regarding the source, recovery circumstances, and long-term planning for anomalous objects and entities in containment. Most senior research staff, project managers, security officers, response team members, and Mobile Task Force operatives hold a Level 3 security clearance.

> 
### Level 4 [Top Secret]
Level 4 security clearances are given to senior administration that require access to site-wide and/or regional intelligence as well as long-term strategic data regarding Foundation operations and research projects. Level 4 security clearances are typically only held by Site Directors, Security Directors, or Mobile Task Force Commanders.

> **Note:** The **[REDACTED]** have access to Level 4 clearance due to the ultimate severity of their tasks.

### Level 5 [Thaumiel]
Level 5 security clearances are given to the highest-ranking administrative personnel within the Foundation and grant effectively unlimited access to all strategic and otherwise sensitive data. Level 5 security clearances are typically only granted to O5 Council members and selected staff.
