# Positions
The declassified positions of the Foundation are listed below. To apply, please join our Discord and use **The Gamemaster** role application system.



## Administration

### O5 Council
The O5 Council is all-knowing and responsible for managing the internal, external, and administrative affairs of the Foundation. The 05 Council is not permitted to have direct contact with any SCPs due to the severity of their positions within the Foundation. The whereabouts on how to apply for the O5 Council are unknown. There are currently **13 council members,** however direct contact has only ever been approved to four of them. The 05 Council is responsible for the worldwide and long-term strategic plans of the Foundation.

### Site Directors
Site Directors for major Foundation facilities are some of the highest ranking personnel in the Foundation, excluding the 05 Council. Site Directors at lesser Foundation facilities do not receive the same authority as the information and power they receive is lesser to that of a great facility director. Site Directors are responsible for the containment, safe operation, and management for their assigned site. All departments in a site must report to their Site Director, who will then report to the 05 Council.

## Field Operatives
### Mobile Task Force Operatives
Mobile Task Force Operatives are veteran, experienced field agents who are each assigned to a team. These tasks are frequently mobilized and it's member can differ as far as war heroes to experienced researchers.  It is often the case the Mobile Tasks Force Operatives are heavily harmed and should only be used to secure hostile anomalous entities. 

### Field Agents
Field Agents are responsible for worldwide investigations into the discovery of new SCPs. Field Agents are personnel  who are trained and placed in a local police department, health department, or any other type of government related service to monitor for any anomalous activity. Once an incident has been confirmed and isolated, Field Agents are to call for assistance from the nearest **Containment Unit**

## Site Staff
### Containment Specialist

Containment specialists have two main roles at Foundation facilities. Firstly, containment teams are called upon to respond to confirmed cases of anomalous activity to secure and establish initial containment over anomalous objects, entities, or phenomena and transport them to the nearest Foundation containment site.

In addition, Foundation containment engineers and technicians are called upon to devise, refine, and maintain containment units and schemes for objects, entities, and phenomena in Foundation facilities.

### Researcher

Researchers are the scientific branch of the Foundation, drawn from the ranks of the smartest and best-trained research scientists from around the world. With specialists in every field imaginable, from chemistry and botany to more esoteric or specialized fields such as theoretical physics and xenobiology, the goal of the Foundation's research projects is to gain a better understanding of unexplained anomalies and how they operate.

### Security Officer

On-site security officers — often referred to simply as guards — at Foundation facilities are tasked with maintaining physical and information security for Foundation projects, operations, and personnel. Primarily drawn and recruited from military, law enforcement, and correctional facility personnel, security officers are trained in the use of all types of weapons as well as a variety of contingency plans covering both containment breach incidents as well as hostile action. These personnel are also responsible for  _information_  security, such as making sure that sensitive documents are not misplaced and that a facility's computer systems are safe from outside intrusion. They are also often the first line of defense against hostile outside forces for Foundation facilities.
